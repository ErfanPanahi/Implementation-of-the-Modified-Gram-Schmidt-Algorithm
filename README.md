# Implementation-of-the-Modified-Gram-Schmidt-Algorithm
In this repository, I intend to implement the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The original Gram-Schmidt algorithm is quite susceptible to errors caused by rounding, etc. To address this, a modified version of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm will be introduced.
